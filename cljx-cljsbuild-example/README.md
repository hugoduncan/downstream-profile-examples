# cljx-cljsbuild-example

An example project with profiles from dev versions of cljsbuild and cljx.

## Usage

You will need to checkout my
[cljx fork](https://github.com/hugoduncan/cljx) and
[cljsbuild fork](https://github.com/hugoduncan/lein-cljsbuild) and
install the feature/add-project-profile branches of each.

You will need a version of leiningen with
https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/pull/1673 applied.  The patch
has still some issues, so you can use the
`technomancy-profiles-from-plugins` branch from
[my leiningen fork](https://github.com/hugoduncan/leiningen).
